    "* it is always good to check how many data are missing - and how can we solve missing data in this dataset?\n",
    "* what data types have different columns?\n",
    "* what could be set as index? And does it make sense here?\n",
    "* price column can be for sure better formated\n",
    "* can we spot some outliers? What method to see outliers can be used?\n",
    "* Total area can be in metres (we are in Austria) and numeric, loft size as well\n",
    "* who is the most active broker?\n",
    "* what is most sold object type?\n",
    "* can you do nice visualisation of the data?\n",
    "* is there a correlation between price and size? Can we see it?\n",
    "* is there any other patterns to discribe?"
